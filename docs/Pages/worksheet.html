            <p>
              the early idea-generation phase was done through a broad design space of research interests to a set of concrete concept directions. Starting from key thematic areas such as conversational AI, multi-agent systems, embodied interaction, and generative models, the ideas branch into multiple speculative scenarios that explore how social pragmatic signals—like turn-taking, interruption, persuasion, and group dynamics—could be made visible and experiential through AI avatars. The figure captures how diverse concepts (e.g., interviews, dilemmas, persuasion games, creative collaboration, and historical simulations) emerged as alternative ways to investigate the same underlying research question, supporting an exploratory and divergent design process before narrowing toward a final project direction

            <p>
              In this project, the Gantt chart was used to structure and communicate the progression of our work from initial problem formulation to final delivery. The chart illustrates how phases such as literature study, concept development, implementation, testing, and report writing overlapped rather than occurring strictly sequentially. This shows the iterative nature of the project, where technical development, evaluation, and documentation informed each other continuously, ensuring steady progress and alignment with project deadlines.

            <p>
              A Kanban board was used to support the day-to-day management of tasks throughout the project.
              It provided a visual overview of the current status of various tasks, helping the team prioritize work and maintain focus on key deliverables.
              This approach was particularly useful in an development process and writting phase, beacuse it allows the team to quickly adapt priorities, manage parallel work, and maintain a clear overview of individual and shared responsibilities.

          <p>
            While an agile approach was chosen to frame the overall project, the defined sprints primarily served as focus periods rather than strict boundaries. Work such as implementation, testing, and refinement occurred across multiple sprints as needed. This flexible structure allowed the team to adapt to emerging insights and technical challenges while still maintaining a clear project overview and progression.

          <p><strong>The Sprints</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Sprint 1:</strong> [08/09 - 06/10] - Through this sprint the goal was to cover the project startup, problem formulation, and lastly an extensive literature study. The focus was on defining the research question, understanding relevant theory, and establishing a solid conceptual and methodological foundation for the project. </p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Sprint 2:</strong> [29/09 - 27/10] - During this sprint, insights from the literature were translated into concrete system concepts and design decisions. This included defining the system architecture, interaction flow, and evaluation approach, while iteratively refining the project scope.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Sprint 3:</strong> [06/10 - 17/11] - The implementation sprint focused on developing the core system, including speech pipelines, agent behavior, and interaction logic. Development was iterative, with continuous testing and adjustments based on technical constraints and emerging findings.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Sprint 4:</strong> [17/11 - 01/12] - This sprint concentrated on system testing, evaluation design, and data collection. The team worked on refining the evaluation methodology, conducting pilot tests, and gathering initial user feedback to inform final adjustments.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Sprint 5:</strong> [01/12 - 15/12] - The final sprint was dedicated to analyzing evaluation data, drawing conclusions, and compiling the project report. The focus was on synthesizing findings, reflecting on the development process, and articulating lessons learned and future directions.</p>

          <h3 id="Challenges">Challenges & Solutions</h3>
          <p>
            Many challenges were faced during the project development, here is a summary of the most important ones and how they were solved:
          </p>

          <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Enable GPU support for Whisper / Lama</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What went wrong: To be able to run, Whisper / Lama need to run on stronger computers</li>
            <li>Why it mattered: High accuracy - needed to run system</li>
            <li>Solution: Bought new graphic cards for strong PC, and used windows ditaction on slower PC's</li>
            <li>Learning: Implement user fallback mechanisms, and implement different solutions for diverse specs</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Turn taking logic - speaker priority</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What went wrong: Sometimes both talked at the same time, and it having problem with who turns it was</li>
            <li>Why it mattered: Balanced amount of answers from both ECA's</li>
            <li>Solution: Explicit turn-taking phases</li>
            <li>Learning: Sometimes the simple solutions is the way to go</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Challenge 3:</strong> User autonomy</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What went wrong: The user of the system had to many options for camera-controls, which lead to inconsitent camera movement</li>
            <li>Why it mattered: They needed to look at the npc, to simulate at real life conversation</li>
            <li>Solution: Static Camera</li>
            <li>Learning: Focus on what is being research</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Challenge 4:</strong> Slow TTS</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What went wrong: It generated the whole prompt in go, which lead to it taking to long</li>
            <li>Why it mattered: Latency and therefore ruined immersion</li>
            <li>Solution: Sentence level chunking</li>
            <li>Learning: Optimization of chunking process</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Challenge 5:</strong> LLM Think Mode</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What went wrong: It took to long to think, and it showed its thoughts in the prompt</li>
            <li>Why it mattered: Went to slow, and therefore ruined immersion</li>
            <li>Solution: Sacrifies intelligence for speed, control and accuracy</li>
            <li>Learning: Found Model without chain of thoughts</li>

          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Performance:</strong> FPS: 370 - 500, memory: 3,4 GB</p>
          <p><strong>Feedback:</strong> "I felt that they not just heard what I said, but also understood it and could put other words on it as well." </p>

          <h3 id="PersonalReflection">Team Reflection</h3>
          <p><strong>What We Learned through this project:</strong> Through this project, we learned the complexity of desiging a conversational AI systems. We gained experience integrating speech recognition, large language models, text-to-speech synthesis, and non-verbal behaviour into a single real-time pipeline. Beyond the technical aspects, we studied the theory of grounding theory and turn-taking pragmatics.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Skills Improved:</strong> We improved our AI engineering skills in Unity and C#, particularly in managing the real-time pipeline. Our understanding of deploying and optimizing local LLMs, ASR, and TTS systems deepened, especially regarding latency trade-offs and streaming architectures. On a softer level, we improved collaboration, documentation, and research communication by working in a parallel workflow between implementation, user evaluation, and academic writing.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>What we Do Differently:</strong> If we were to redo the project, we would introduce baseline comparison conditions, such as a single-agent or text-only version, to better isolate the effect of multi-agent coordination. We would also allocate more time to refining non-verbal behaviour, as user feedback showed that gesture and movement quality still lagged behind attentiveness and verbal coherence. Furthermore, we would plan for a more diverse participant sample beyond university students.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Professional Growth:</strong> This project contributed to our growth by shifting our mindset from building more static systems to systems that are adaptable to the users. </p>
