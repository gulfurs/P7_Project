                        the early idea-generation phase was done through a broad design space of research interests to a set of concrete concept directions. Starting from key thematic areas such as conversational AI, multi-agent systems, embodied interaction, and generative models, the ideas branch into multiple speculative scenarios that explore how social pragmatic signals—like turn-taking, interruption, persuasion, and group dynamics—could be made visible and experiential through AI avatars. The figure captures how diverse concepts (e.g., interviews, dilemmas, persuasion games, creative collaboration, and historical simulations) emerged as alternative ways to investigate the same underlying research question, supporting an exploratory and divergent design process before narrowing toward a final project direction

                        In this project, the Gantt chart was used to structure and communicate the progression of our work from initial problem formulation to final delivery. The chart illustrates how phases such as literature study, concept development, implementation, testing, and report writing overlapped rather than occurring strictly sequentially. This shows the iterative nature of the project, where technical development, evaluation, and documentation informed each other continuously, ensuring steady progress and alignment with project deadlines.

                        A Kanban board was used to support the day-to-day management of tasks throughout the project.
                        It provided a visual overview of the current status of various tasks, helping the team prioritize work and maintain focus on key deliverables.
                        This approach was particularly useful in an development process and writting phase, beacuse it allows the team to quickly adapt priorities, manage parallel work, and maintain a clear overview of individual and shared responsibilities.

                    While an agile approach was chosen to frame the overall project, the defined sprints primarily served as focus periods rather than strict boundaries. Work such as implementation, testing, and refinement occurred across multiple sprints as needed. This flexible structure allowed the team to adapt to emerging insights and technical challenges while still maintaining a clear project overview and progression.

                <p>
                    Many challenges were faced during the project development, here is a summary of the most important ones and how they were solved:
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Enable GPU support for Whisper / Lama</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What went wrong: To be able to run, Whisper / Lama need to run on stronger computers</li>
                    <li>Why it mattered: High accuracy - needed to run system</li>
                    <li>Solution: Bought new graphic cards for strong PC, and used windows ditaction on slower PC's</li>
                    <li>Learning: Implement user fallback mechanisms, and implement different solutions for diverse specs</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Turn taking logic - speaker priority</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What went wrong: Sometimes both talked at the same time, and it having problem with who turns it was</li>
                    <li>Why it mattered: Balanced amount of answers from both ECA's</li>
                    <li>Solution: Explicit turn-taking phases</li>
                    <li>Learning: Sometimes the simple solutions is the way to go</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>What went wrong: The user of the system had to many options for camera-controls, which lead to inconsitent camera movement</li>
                    <li>Why it mattered: They needed to look at the npc, to simulate at real life conversation</li>
                    <li>Solution: Static Camera</li>
                    <li>Learning: Focus on what is being research</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>What went wrong: It generated the whole prompt in go, which lead to it taking to long</li>
                    <li>Why it mattered: Latency and therefore ruined immersion</li>
                    <li>Solution: Sentence level chunking</li>

                    <li>Why it mattered: Went to slow, and therefore ruined immersion</li>
                    <li>Solution: Sacrifies intelligence for speed, control and accuracy</li>

                <h3 id="PersonalReflection">Team Reflection</h3>
                <p><strong>What We Learned through this project:</strong> Through this project, we learned how complex it is to design conversational AI systems that feel socially natural rather than merely functional. We gained experience integrating speech recognition, large language models, text-to-speech synthesis, and non-verbal behaviour into a single real-time pipeline. Beyond the technical aspects, we learned the importance of grounding theory, turn-taking pragmatics, and user perception when evaluating human–AI interaction. The project also highlighted how interdisciplinary work—combining HCI theory, AI engineering, and user studies—is essential when building embodied conversational agents.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Skills Improved:</strong> We significantly improved our programming skills in Unity and C#, particularly in managing real-time pipelines, asynchronous processing, and native plugin integration. Our understanding of deploying and optimizing local LLMs, ASR, and TTS systems deepened, especially regarding latency trade-offs and streaming architectures. Additionally, we strengthened our problem-solving abilities by debugging timing issues, coordinating multi-agent turn-taking, and aligning verbal output with non-verbal animations. On a softer level, we improved collaboration, documentation, and research communication by iterating between implementation, evaluation, and academic writing.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>What we Do Differently:</strong> If we were to redo the project, we would introduce baseline comparison conditions earlier, such as a single-agent or text-only version, to better isolate the effect of multi-agent coordination. We would also allocate more time to refining non-verbal behaviour, as user feedback showed that gesture and movement quality still lagged behind attentiveness and verbal coherence. Furthermore, we would plan for a more diverse participant sample beyond university students and incorporate additional validated presence measures to strengthen the reliability of the evaluation.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Professional Growth:</strong> This project contributed significantly to our professional growth by shifting our mindset from building systems that merely “work” to systems that are responsible, interpretable, and empirically evaluated. We developed a stronger engineering mindset focused on trade-offs, such as balancing computational performance, latency, privacy, and user perception. Conducting a structured user study and safety evaluation reinforced our sense of scientific responsibility, emphasizing transparency, ethical considerations, and methodological rigor when developing AI systems intended for real-world use.</p>
